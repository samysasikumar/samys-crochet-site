    <p>
        Hi! I'm the creator of Samy's Crochet. I started crocheting
        because I love creating cute and meaningful handmade items.
        What began as a hobby turned into a small business where I
        design plushies, accessories, and gifts for others to enjoy.
    </p>

    <p>
        I also enjoy combining creativity with design and technology,
        and I’m excited to keep growing my skills in both areas.
    </p>
